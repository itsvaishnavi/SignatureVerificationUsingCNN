This is the offline signature verification project, which identifies whether the signature is original or fraud.
Also, we can get the similarity between the two signatures.
For this, we have also created the UI to test the signature and get the similarity.
Flask framework is used to do this and neural network uses keras Conv2D. In this we get accuracy of 92%.

To run the project from command line, run the following command:
python image_upload1.py
